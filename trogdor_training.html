<h1>Training with Trogdor the Burninator</h1>

<!-- information about your location -->
<p>
As you approach the dragon, you see a sign that says 'Trogdor the Burninator-peasants beware!'  Despite that intimidating sign, you continue forward to go ask
the dragon-keeper for a job.  Right before you can get your first word out, 
Trogdor decides that you look like a peasant and burninates you to a crisp
before you can say 'whoa!'

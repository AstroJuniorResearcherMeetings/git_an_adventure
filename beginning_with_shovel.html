<p>
You are still at the Dead End but now you have a shovel
<br>
You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
from each other.
There is no shovel here (cause you have it)

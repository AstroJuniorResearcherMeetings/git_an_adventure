<h1>The Cliffs of Insanity</h1>

<!-- information about your location -->
<p>
After walking down the road more traveled, you see a break in the trees and come upon a wide cliff overlooking the sea. The wind is brutal as it whips across your face. Off to the right, you see a rocky terrain with many footprints.

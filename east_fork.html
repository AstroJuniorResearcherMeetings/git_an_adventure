<h1>Fork in The Road</h1>
<hr>

<!-- information about your location -->
<p>
TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood,	
And sorry I could not travel both	
And be one traveler, long I stood	
And looked down one as far as I could	
To where it bent in the undergrowth;	        5
 
Then took the other, as just as fair,	
And having perhaps the better claim,	
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;	
Though as for that the passing there	
Had worn them really about the same
</p>

(Oh, there's also a Time Machine here)

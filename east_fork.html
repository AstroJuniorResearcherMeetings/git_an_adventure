<h1>Fork in The Road</h1>
<hr>

<!-- information about your location -->
<p>
TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br>
And sorry I could not travel both    <br>
And be one traveler, long I stood    <br>	
And looked down one as far as I could<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth, <br>       5
 
Then took the other, as just as fair, <br>
And having perhaps the better claim,  <br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
Though as for that the passing there  <br>
Had worn them really about the same   <br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
(Oh, there's also a Time Machine here)

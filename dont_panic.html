<h1>Don't Panic!</h1>

<p>
You didn't panic as you fell through the wormhole because you knew you had your lovely towel. After a lovely ride through a very mystical plane of existence you find yourself in what appears to be a house made of jello. Not knowing what sort of inhabitants are found in jello homes you consult your guide.

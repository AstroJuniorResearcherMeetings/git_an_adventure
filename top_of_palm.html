<h1>Top of Palm Tree</h1>
<hr>

<!-- information about your location -->
<p>
You just climbed to the top of a very tall palm tree next to a road. All around you large birds are flying and you have to duck to avoid them. Off in the distance you see a beach and the ocean. You also see a circus caravan going to set up in a nearby field.

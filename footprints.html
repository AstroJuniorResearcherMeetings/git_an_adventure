<h1>The Remains of a Duel</h1>
<hr>

<!-- information about your location -->
<p>
You follow the footprints along the edge of the cliff to a wide open area with many rocky edges. The footprints go round and round in a dance. "Aha!" you think to yourself. Here has been a mighty duel! Both were masters. There is a patch of disturbed dust where you theorize a body must have lain. One set of footprints lead back into the forest, though it is a much darker and more menacing forest than the one you came from. You also see a ship in the harbor back off the cliffs.

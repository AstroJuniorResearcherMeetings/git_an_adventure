<h1>November 5, 1955</h1>

<!-- information about your location -->
<p>
Whoa! Your time machine comes crashing to a stop in a picturesque town square. You pick up a newspaper and see the date is November 5, 1955. You see an old clocktower in front of you and a soda fountain off to your left. You also see a car parked at the texaco with the keys in the ignition. Some mean bullies run by and make off with your hat. You see a kid with a skateboard tying his shoes next to you.

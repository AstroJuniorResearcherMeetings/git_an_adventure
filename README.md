__Tips__
______________________________________________

To check the status of your directory


	git status

For help on any git command type --help

	git --help 

	git add --help

	git merge --help

Keep the git figure in mind. Each arrow is a git command (e.g. git add ==> puts files from the working directory to the cache)

You're really tired from your long dig, but luckily you pick up an
English-Chinese dictionary on the ground, and it's really easy to read. 
You are totally ready to mingle with the locals, which is great, because
after such a long dig you can really use a lemonade and a snack. There's a lemon tree
to your left, or a mysterious but appetizing smell wafting in from your right.

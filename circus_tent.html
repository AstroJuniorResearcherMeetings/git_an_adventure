<h1>Within the Excitement of the Circus Tent</h1>
<hr>

<!-- information about your location -->
<p>
A seven-ring circus occupies the gigantic tent you have entered.  The performers
are rehearsing for their show that night.  In one of the side rings a gigantic
dragon with a really buff human arm practices incinerating thatched-roof 
cottages.  In another ring you see a man setting climbing into a large cannon.
But it is the center ring that really catches your attention.  There you see 
the impossible happening.  A magnetic monopole is being created right before
your very eyes!
